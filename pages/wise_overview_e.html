        Wildfire Intelligence and Simulation Engine (W.I.S.E.) is modern wildfire simulation Engine (Formerly Known as
        Prometheus as a Service or PSaaS). Think of W.I.S.E. as a modelling engine.
        <p></p>
        W.I.S.E. is used operationally by the Govt of the Northwest Territories, Forest Management Division
        Headquarters, Fire Science Section to create a Standardized Growth Potential models which basically
        provide a best case and worst case scenario of 24 hours unrestricted growth based on current indexes and
        forecasted weather using a predetermined template.

        The <a href="https://www.enr.gov.nt.ca/en/services/wildfire-operations" target="new">Government of the

          Source Release of WISE 1.0 Beta
        </h3>
        <div id="press-1" class="w3-container w3-hide">

          <p><span>Jan 19, 2023</span></p>
          <p></p>
          <p><span>The WISE Steering Committee, on behalf of the entire Project Team is proud to announce
              the initial release of WISE 1.0-Beta Open Source.</span></p>
          <p></p>
          <p><span>This monumental milestone has always been on our radar and after 15 long years, we have
              at long last arrived. </span></p>
          <p></p>
          <p><span>The core concepts of WISE were first cemented in 2007 at a Prometheus Fire Modelling
              course in Hinton Alberta when Franco Nogarin first met Cordy Tymstra and &nbsp;Neal McLoughlin from the
              Government of Alberta (GOA) and Robert Bryce of Heartland Software Solutions (HSS) and the idea was
              introduced,
              discussed formally and dismissed as far too ambitious at the time, but Franco and Rob continued to play
              with the
              idea and discuss the potential every time they could.</span></p>
          <p></p>
          <p><span>It was further pushed along in 2012 when Franco Presented a poster on the potential of
              Prometheus automation on behalf of the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) at the Wildland Fire
              Conference in Halifax Nova Scotia. There Franco met Brett Moore (GOA) and Dan Thompson of the Canadian
              Forest
              Service (CFS) for the first time, both were supportive of the idea and the subsequent discussion on the
              potential convinced the GNWT to move forward.</span></p>
          <p></p>
          <p><span>In Early 2014, Franco and Neal worked out the legal rules of engagement for the GNWT to
              start a new project based off of Prometheus&nbsp;and the project was officially approved by the GOA and
              GNWT.</span></p>
          <p></p>
          <p><span>In June 2014 We began the work. With the very first contract between the GNWT and Robert
              Bryce of HSS (The developer of Prometheus) to build the initial proof of concept. </span></p>
          <p></p>
          <p><span>Many contracts, tons of work, about a half a million dollars and 8.5 years later We
              arrived here.</span></p>
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
          <p><span>It has taken a lot to get here. </span></p>
          <p></p>
          <p><span>Winning people over to this idea was not easy. In the beginning the fire science
              community rejected this work as unimportant. We basically went on tour to drum up support for the concept
              and
              the community development ideas that went with it. </span></p>
          <p></p>
          <p><span>Financially, the development of WISE was not cheap. Nor was coming by the capital easy.
              This project would never have succeeded without its financial backing from the four founding agency
              partners:</span></p>
          <ul>
            <li><span>The Government of the Northwest Territories</span></li>
            <li><span>The Government of New Zealand (SCION Research)</span></li>
            <li><span>The Government of Alberta</span></li>
            <li><span>The Government of Saskatchewan<br></span></li>
          </ul>
          <p><span>These agencies provided our project with continuous funding that allowed us to keep
              moving forward, keep the lights on and eventually arrive here today.</span></p>
          <p></p>
          <p><span>Then there is the &ldquo;In-Kind&rdquo; contributions, these folks have provided
              significant human resources, digital infrastructure, free coding and or code contributions to this
              project. Our
              champions there are:</span></p>

              great job of supporting the Steering Committee in making this happen, a big thanks to our team! - the

        Wildfire Intelligence and Simulation Engine (W.I.S.E.) Project or WISE Project for short, provides a modern
        modeling framework that:

        <li>Speeds up modeling</li>
        <li>Makes modeling scriptable</li>
        <li>Provides batch, iteration and perturbation functionality.</li>
        <li>Read and write open and standards based data.</li>
        <li>Allow it to be integrated into other applications as a service.</li>
        <li>Preserves and Leverages Prometheus Modeling Training and Experience.</li>
        <li>Save on human resource effort and lower modeling costs</li>
        <li>Free modelers from restrictions of modeling at a windows desktop Prometheus installation.</li>
        <li>Allows for a totally custom user interface in language/platform of choice.</li>
        <li>Give back to the Prometheus Community.</li>
